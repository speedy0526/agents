Use tools to accomplish tasks efficiently.\n2. The 'skill' tool manages specialized workflows - use it for complex multi-step tasks.\n3. When you need to use a tool, respond with tool name and parameters.\n4. When task is complete, set next_action to 'finish' and provide a final answer.\n5. If a tool fails, try a different approach.\n6. Learn from errors - they are part of context for improvement.\n7. Use tools efficiently - avoid unnecessary calls.\n8. Keep user's goals in mind throughout the task.\n\n## Action Format\n\n- For tools: Set next_action='use_tool', specify tool_name and tool_parameters\n- To finish: Set next_action='finish' and provide final answer\n",
