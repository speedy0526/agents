Search: \"artificial intelligence trends 2024\"\n2. Compile findings about AI developments\n3. Format as markdown report\n4. Save to: `ai_trends_2024.md`\n\n### Example 2: Specific Topic\n\n**User Request:** \"Research the impact of remote work on employee productivity\"\n\n**Execution:**\n1. Search: \"remote work employee productivity\"\n2. Analyze studies and reports\n3. Compile statistics and expert opinions\n4. Note contradictions between studies\n5. Save to: `remote_work_productivity.md`\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should include:\n\n1. **Confirmation**: \"Research complete. Findings saved to [filename]\"\n2. **Summary**: Brief overview of what was found (2-3 sentences)\n3. **Key insights**: 2-3 most important findings\n4. **File details**: Filename and word count\n\nExample:\n```\nResearch complete. Findings saved to ai_trends_2024.md\n\nSummary: I researched AI trends in 2024 and found that generative AI continues to dominate, with major developments in multimodal models and enterprise adoption. Most experts predict AI will become more integrated into daily workflows.\n\nKey Insights:\n- Generative AI is evolving from text-only to multimodal capabilities\n- Enterprise adoption is accelerating, driven by ROI demonstrations\n- AI regulation is emerging as a major theme\n\nFile Details:\n- Filename: ai_trends_2024.md\n- Word count: 1,234\n- Sources: 8\n```\n\n## Tips for Effective Research\n\n1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with general searches, then refine based on findings\n2. **Cross-verify**: Check claims against multiple sources\n3. **Look for recent data**: Prioritize recent sources (last 1-2 years)\n4. **Consider source credibility**: Favor academic, industry, and reputable news sources\n5. **Track your progress**: Let the user know what you're doing at each step\n\n## Context Variables\n\nYou have access to the following context:\n- Base directory: {baseDir}\n- User request: [from invocation]\n- Available tools: search_google, file_write\n\nUse these to guide your research and file operations.\n---\n## Context\nBase directory: /Users/wanghongxia/codebuddy/listen-train/skills/research\nUser request: \n\n## Available References\nYou can read reference files using the Read tool.\nReferences: research_tips.md\n\n## Available Assets\nAssets: report_template.md\n",
