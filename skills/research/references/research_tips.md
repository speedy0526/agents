# Research Tips and Best Practices

## Search Strategies

### Effective Keywords
- Use specific, targeted keywords
- Combine concepts with AND/OR operators
- Use quotes for exact phrases: "machine learning"
- Use minus to exclude terms: AI -stock market
- Include synonyms and related terms

### Boolean Operators
- `AND`: Both terms must appear
- `OR`: Either term can appear
- `NOT`: Exclude a term
- `()`: Group terms together

### Search Modifiers
- `site:` - Search specific website
- `filetype:` - Search specific file types (e.g., pdf)
- `intitle:` - Term must appear in title
- `inurl:` - Term must appear in URL
- `before:` - Date before (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `after:` - Date after (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Source Evaluation

### Trustworthy Sources
- Academic journals and papers
- Government publications
- Established news organizations
- Industry research reports
- University websites

### Questionable Sources
- Personal blogs (unless expert)
- Forums and social media
- Content mills
- Sites with clear bias/agenda
- Outdated information

### Cross-Verification
- Verify claims with multiple sources
- Check for citations and references
- Look for peer-reviewed content
- Be skeptical of extraordinary claims

## Information Synthesis

### Pattern Recognition
- Look for recurring themes
- Identify consensus opinions
- Note outliers and contradictions
- Track trends over time

### Organizing Information
- Group related findings
- Create logical flow
- Use clear headings
- Include relevant quotes
- Add source citations

### Critical Thinking
- Question assumptions
- Look for evidence, not just assertions
- Consider alternative viewpoints
- Identify gaps in information
- Assess methodology quality

## Common Research Pitfalls

1. **Confirmation Bias**: Only seeking sources that agree with your preconceptions
2. **Outdated Information**: Relying on old data in fast-changing fields
3. **Anecdotal Evidence**: Treating personal stories as representative
4. **Single Source**: Relying on just one source
5. **Misinterpretation**: Taking quotes out of context
6. **Lack of Context**: Presenting facts without necessary background
